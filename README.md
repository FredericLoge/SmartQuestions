Figuring out which questions to ask next, in a prediction context, using Approximate Dynamic Programming [ADP]. 
In this repository, you will find 5 examples using ADP on either toy models or benchmark datasets where only three questions are allowed (with 5 to 11 potential questions) and the task is to predict a class or a continuous value.
